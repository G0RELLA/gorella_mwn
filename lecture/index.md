# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the GORELLA module "Methodological work in the neurosciences", we're glad to see you here!
For more information on the GORELLA project see
[here](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/).

Within these pages, we provide the entire materials and content of the module as it was taught at the [Philipps-University Marburg]()
during the summer term 2021.

## What's all this now?

GORELLA stands for "Generalizable Outline for Realistic Empirical Life
Science Lectures and their Applications". It is a framework aimed to
improve openness and sustainability in scientific teaching and training.
GORELLA is designed to help prepare and supply lecture content
in a way that it is [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) for as
many people as possible.

Applied to the module at hand, this includes the following sections:

* [Overview & Setup](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/overview.html)

   What's the problem, how do we propose to solve it and what do we need for this?

* [General procedure](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/procedure.html)

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Project & data management](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/project_management.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and scientific projects are no exception to
   that, but how? Additionally, how should projects and data be managed throughout its life cycle?

* [Data analyses](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/data_analyses.html)

   How to obtain insights from data?

* [Results communication](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/results_communication.html)

   Where should the acquired knowledge to be disseminated?

* [Symposium](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/symposium.html)

   What to do about outreach and discourse creation?

* [Student projects](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and
   documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [GORELLA tutorial](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/tutorial.html)

   Are there guidelines on how to start?

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_mwn/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.
