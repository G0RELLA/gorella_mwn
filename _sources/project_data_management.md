## Lecture/Practice 2 - Basics

### [Introduction to the shell]()

Within this lecture/practice mix the [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29), specifically [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)),
as one of the central tools, we will be introduced and general concepts,
as well as functions be explored.

### [Introduction to version control using git]()

How to keep track of all the things that happen to projects, including
code and data? Spoiler: the classic `_version1`, `_version2`, etc. approach
is not the best option. Thus, within this lecture/practice mix [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
via [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) will be introduced and explored. This will also include aspects of
simultaneous collaborative working.

## Outcomes
The main outcomes for this block is to build up the general setting for your project.

### OSF & GitHub project

- Use the template for register your own project on GitHub
- Link between those two plattforms

## Open lab notebook
- Document all the steps you performed in your open lab notebook on github

### Preregistration & data management plan
- Find open data you want to use in your project and write an data management plan
- Combine all introduced steps (theory building, literature search, data search, data management plan, project plan, hyposesis, ...) to preregister your study on OSF
